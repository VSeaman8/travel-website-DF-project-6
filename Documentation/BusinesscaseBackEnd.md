### Introduction

The Travel Info Web Application has been available to users for several weeks, during which DFCorp has gathered valuable feedback on areas for improvement and enhancement. This document outlines user-reported issues and highlights the necessity of developing a robust backend service to address these limitations and elevate the overall user experience.

### Problems that Backend Services will Solve

In the initial release of the Travel Info Web Application, users could only save their favourite locations on the device they were using. Consequently, if they accessed the app from a different device, they would need to search for the locations again. This lack of personalization diminished the overall user experience and reduced the application's engagement and usefulness.

### **Benefits to the User:**

- **Personalization**: With the implementation of backend services, users can create individual accounts and securely store their favourite locations. This functionality ensures that favorite locations are accessible across multiple devices, addressing the previous limitation and providing users with a seamless and personalized experience.
- **Convenience**: Users can access their favourite locations from any device once they log in. They no longer need to manually input locations repeatedly, saving time and effort.
- **Security**: Backend services provide secure authentication mechanisms, ensuring that user data remains protected. Password change requests are handled securely, enhancing user confidence in the platform.

### **Impact on Customer's Business:**

- **Improved User Retention**: By offering personalized features and enhanced convenience, the backend services will likely improve user retention rates. Users are more likely to continue using the application when it caters to their individual needs.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**: Personalization and security features contribute to overall customer satisfaction. Satisfied users are more likely to recommend the application to others and engage with additional services offered by DFCorp.
- **Competitive Advantage**: In the competitive landscape of travel applications, offering robust backend services sets DFCorp apart from competitors. It demonstrates a commitment to user experience and data security, attracting a larger user base and strengthening the company's position in the market.

### Conclusion

In summary, the backend services address critical user experience gaps while enhancing convenience and security. These improvements are integral to the long-term success and growth of DFCorp's travel application.
